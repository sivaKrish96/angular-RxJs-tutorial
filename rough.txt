RxJs Tutorial:

1. In Angular we using the RxJs to make the asynchronous call as well as the callback function call.
2. In angular we have an three important topics:
    1. Observable
    2. Observer --> next, complete, error
    3. Operator

3. If any changes in the data the observable was emit the data over a time. if you using the subscriber then
    only you should get an changed data.

4. observables need to subscribed otherwise observable doesn't to anything own.

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable((observer)=>{
    // here emiting the values
    try {
         observer.next('Ram');
         observer.next('Siva');
         observer.complete();
    }
    catch(eror){
         observer.error('oops');
    }
})

const observer = {
    // here we receiving the values
    next: value => console.log(value),
    error: error => console.log(error),
    complete: () => console.log('Completed')
}

// here we are making the connection between the observable to observer using the subscribe method then only the 
// observable receives the observer as an object.
observable.subscribe(observer)
